#Hello, Everybody here.

##Thanks for comin out!

###Just a little background on me!

1. I am not a professional programmer, I am just another camper like you.
  * I will try to answer all questions best as I can but will not hesitate to refer you to another resource or simply tell you that I don't know that answer.

2. I have been studying nothing but javascript the last 7 months or so now, and it has practically become my obsession.

3. I am just beginning to seek a job, build up my portfolio, etc... but I am certainly open to any opportunities now! (Shameless plug had to do it!)

4. I am very detail oriented and I promise I won't lead any of you astray, you will be learning many best practices, and I will try my best to give you contextual grounds for everything that you learned.

5. I just learned all of this stuff no more than a few months ago, so I am really familiar with the challenges you may face while learning. Hopefully I will be able to connect some dots better than more experienced guides!
