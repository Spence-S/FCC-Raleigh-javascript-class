#Assumptions about you!

1. You know a little bit of javascript already. You have completed some interactive online tutorial such as free code camps javascript track or code academy's or a similar tutorial.

2. You may have used a text editor to write some code (Great if you have!) but probably have not set up your own webserver, nor ran your code from your own cutomized dev environment.

3. You have not worked with React at all, but you are excited about it.

4. You may have heard or read about some es6 concepts, but haven't really used them yet. eg.. arrow functions, javascript classes, promises, destructuring, etc...

5. You aren't sure where to get started learning more advanced stuff, all the tutorials are either way too easy, or way too hard for you. You need some dots connected.
