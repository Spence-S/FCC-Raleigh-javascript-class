#Node what?!
###I thought we were going to be working with React!?!?!

Well you got a bit ahead of yourself cowboy!

In these days of javascript, you will be developing nearly all of your javascript in a node.js based environment. So we aren't going to waste our time jumping straight into react, when virtually there is no practical reason to do so besides to get you excited to learn!

###What is Node?
Node is a platform and environment, that basically uses the chrome javascript engine to write javascript code off the browser.

If that is confusing, lets put it in to more context. See in web programming, there is server side code, and client side code. A server is basically program allows a piece of hardware to "listen" for requests made by clients.
*This is only somewhat correct, but it is a fine way to understand it for right now*

When you make a request from your browser by visiting a website, you are actually making a request to some remote server for a certain resource that the server is holding on to or has access to. When the server gets the request, it passes the requested resource back to you. This is usually a set of html, javascript, css files, and possibly images that you see as a website or web app.

[Especcially read this particular article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/First_steps/Introduction)

Node allows us to use javascript to write our own web servers. We will eventually get to this in much more detail in the coming months and write our own fully functional backend API that serves up data to our react front end that we will be building here.

For now, it's enough to know that it is something we all need, and it is something that we all should become familiar with. Even if we want to program primarily in another backend language. There is no reason not to use nodejs to program and compile all of our javascript.

##Now, Go download Node
https://nodejs.org/en/

Follow the instructions.

When you have it installed, open up a terminal or command line and type node -v if you get something back like v6.9.4, then you have it installed correctly.
