#Components, Classes, and Elements

By now, I would hope you have taken a look at the e-book I reccomended. Before diving into this chapter, I really reccomend reading through the first 12 chapters in the book by this point if you aren't able to work with us live. If you are in the live session, we will cover a lot of this, but the 30 days of react should set you on a good path assuming you can't be here. 30 days of react differs in the way they are teaching things because they jump into react code before introducing create-react-app where as we do the opposite. This should not affect much learning, it is just a different teaching strategy.
